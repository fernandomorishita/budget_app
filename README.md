# budget_app
Desktop App - python

I decided to learn python and I wanted a budget control app. Why not do both? Lot of challenges understanding syntaxes and wx.python, but the app worked in the end, and I learned a lot. This code is from 2014 or earlier, and no design principles were followed here. Just plain old code.
